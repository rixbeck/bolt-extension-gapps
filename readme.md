# Google Apps Extensions for Bolt CMS

This project is intended to be a high level interface for some Google Apps Services like getting informations
about Calendars and iterating over upcoming calendar events. All of these calls are organized in a higher level
service call style and many of them wired in twig functions or filters.

While this project is made for part of one of my projects and it is still in a early stage, I haven't still refactored
for general purpose usage, it may need alignments for using efficient.

Some part of the extension may become different extension later as well.

Currently it is a long term progressing project.
